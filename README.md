# vim-auto-cursorline

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1239245/56327655-4c169000-61b6-11e9-8cb8-23d3ca1773a7.gif)

Show / hide cursorline in connection with cursor moving.

## What's this?

This plugin manages the `'cursorline'` option to show only when you need. It
shows / hides in these cases below.

### show

* opening buffers
* moving into another window
* holding the cursor in a certain wait (customizable)

### hide

* moving the cursor

## Why is this plugin needed?

_details in [this entry][qiita] (in Japanese)._

The cursorline option takes heavy CPU usage and makes the cursor move slowly.
In addition, you should need cursorline only when you are missing the cursor.
Hiding cursorline should make it easy to read characters on the line.

##  Install

Clone this repository and add the dir to `'runtimepath'`.

```vim
set runtimepath+=/path/to/this/repo
```

Or, use your favorite plugin managers.

## Setting

### `g:auto_cursorline_wait_ms`

It waits this value milliseconds before hiding cursorline. Default: 1000.

### `b:auto_cursorline_disabled`

When this value is set to `1`, it disables all features. This is a
buffer-specific value, so you may set this with autocmd.

```vim
" this disables all features in JSON filetype.
autocmd FileType json :let b:auto_cursorline_disabled = 1
```

In addition to this, all features are already disabled in terminal windows.

## Background

The idea of this plugin is derived from [this entry][] (in Japanese). One of
the reason why I did “reinventing the wheel” is because the original one uses
the `'updatetime'` option to wait before hiding cursorline. But other plugins,
such as [vim-gitgutter][], uses `'updatetime'` for different usages. I made
this plugin for setting the designated value for the time before hiding the
cursorline.
